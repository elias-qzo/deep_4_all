    "prompt": "Thomas made 4 stacks of wooden blocks. The first stack was 7 blocks tall. The second stack was 3 blocks taller than the first. The third stack was 6 blocks shorter than the second stack, and the fourth stack was 10 blocks taller than the third stack. If the fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the second stack, how many blocks did Thomas use in all?",

The second stack is 3 blocks taller than the first:\n\\[\nS_2 = S_1 + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10.\n\\]\n\n4. The third stack is 6 blocks shorter than the second:\n\\[\nS_3 = S_2 - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4.\n\\]\n\n5.

The fifth stack has twice as many blocks as the second:\n\\[\nS_5 = 2 \\times S_2 = 2 \\times 10 = 20.\n\\]\n\n7.
